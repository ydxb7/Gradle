# ud867: Gradle for Android and Java

Welcome to the demos and exercises accompanying ud867 at Udacity!

Each directory contains a README.md or solution.gradle that will explain either
the concept being explored or the exercise at hand. For each exercise, hints
and a solution.gradle file are also provided.

This course is specifically concerned with the app build process, not writing
apps in the first place. If you're just starting out on your Android journey,
you might want to take Udacity's [Developing Android
Apps](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853) course.

## my note

* 1.0.2 install Gradle
* 1.0.3 Groovy fundamentals: use java to run groovy
* 1.0.4 Groovy fundamentals: closures(闭包): Closures have two interesting features. First, they are just values that can be assigned to a variable, just like a number or a string. Second, they can capture variables from the scope in which they're declared.
